                                    <p>Hello, my name is Christopher Shane Brown.  I know you are wondering if I go by Christopher or Chris, but I actually go by Shane.  My parents didn't that Shane Christopher Brown flowed well, but always intended on calling me Shane.  I was born in Texas, but my family lived in East New Mexico at the time.  The best and closest hospital, however, was in Levelland Texas.  I have lived in different parts of Texas and New Mexico.  In 1996 I graduated from Athens High School and started studying at the University of Texas where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Economics.</p>
                                    <p>It took me a while and several different jobs, but I finally broke into finance in 2009.  I spent the next 10 years as a financial analyst.  Now you may be wondering why would he leave such and illustrious and exciting career.  Well, the answer is two layoffs in three years and not a lot of options, ontop of the fact that I didn't really like it.  I did always like programming and such so full stack web development called to me.</p>
                                    <p>Along with all the fun and exciting stuff you just read, I do have some hobbies.  I like woodworking and would make that my career if possible.  Most of the furniture in my house are things I've built.  I also practiced martial arts for over a decade and had my own school charter at one time.  Lastly I enjoy reading and writing and have published fantasy novel.</p>
